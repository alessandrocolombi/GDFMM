\usage{
predictive_players_fix_partition(ID_ply, dt, fit, burnin = 1, data_med4season)
}
\arguments{
\item{ID_ply}{\link{integer} the index of the player of interest.}

\item{dt}{\link{list} This must be the return object of \code{\link{handle_input}}. The Clustering must be added as well}

\item{fit}{\link{list} the output of a conditional sampler, \code{\link{GDFMM_sampler}} or \code{\link{ConditionalSampler}}}

\item{burnin}{\link{integer} the number of draws from \code{\link{GDFMM_sampler}} that must be discarded.}
}
\value{
\link{matrix} of size ?? containing the quantiles of level \code{0.025,0.5,0.975}.
}
\description{
This function computes the predictive distribution for player \code{ID_ply} generated from \code{\link{ConditionalSampler}}
This function is specific for the case where the partition was kept fixed
