\arguments{
\item{data}{input data}

\item{burnin}{burnin period}

\item{thin}{thinning value}

\item{seed}{seed for GSL random engine (0 ==> random seed)}

\item{P0.prior}{string with the prior to be used as P0}

\item{FixPartition}{TRUE if we want to fix the partition}

\item{option}{list with initial values, hyperparameters and other options.
Value always needed are : "Mstar0", "Lambda0", "mu0", "nu0", "sigma0",
"k0", "Adapt_MH_hyp1", "Adapt_MH_hyp2", "Adapt_MH_power_lim", "Adapt_MH_var0",
"alpha_gamma", "beta_gamma", "alpha_lambda", "beta_lambda".
If FixPartition = TRUE, also value for "partition" is needed}
